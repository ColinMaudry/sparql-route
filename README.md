# SPARQL router 0.2.0

#### A NodeJS/Express application to serve canned SPARQL queries to the world.

## Description

[SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) is the query language to retrieve data from RDF triple stores. I often had the issue that fellow developers or data fanatics asked for data that was in a triple store, but they don't know SPARQL.

This module solves the issue:

1. You write the query and gives it a name (e.g. `biggest-asian-cities`)
2. You save it under /tables, /graphs or /update, depending on the query type (SELECT, CONSTRUCT, DESCRIBE, SPARQL Update)
3. You give the URL to your fellow developer, picking the right format for their usage:
	- `http:/yourhost/tables/biggest-asian-cities.csv` for manipulations as a spreadsheet
	- `http:/yourhost/tables/biggest-asian-cities.json` as input for a Web app
	- `http:/yourhost/tables/biggest-asian-cities.xml` if they are into XML
4. They get fresh updated results from the store every time they hit the URL!

## Features

- Exposes SPARQL queries as simple URLs, with choice of format
- A canned query is a simple `.rq` file located in `/public/tables`, `/public/graphs` or `/public/update` depending on the query type (SELECT, CONSTRUCT, DESCRIBE, SPARQL Update)
- Besides FTP and SSH, you can POST a new canned query to /tables/{query-name}, /graphs/{query-name} or /update/{query-name} (if authenticated)
- Supports content negotiation (via the `Accept` HTTP header)
- Possibility to GET or POST SPARQL queries on `/sparql`, without saving it

**Demo**

An instance is deployed on Heroku, with API documentation:

https://sparql-router.herokuapp.com

You can create new queries through this form. Authentication is currently disabled.

Now it's still jut a useful middleman between your RDF data and your data consumers, but the objective is to develop an open plateform to share SPARQL queries on any endpoint. With a nice UI.

## Requirements

[NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/stable/) must be installed.

They are also available in most Linux package managers as `nodejs` and `npm`.

## Installation

With the test framework:

```bash
npm install sparql-router 
```

Without:
```bash
npm install sparql-router --production
```

## Configuration

The configuration sits in `config/default.json`. The default configuration queries Wikidata.

The most important part is the endpoint configuration, where you configure the default SPARQL endpoint to be used by the queries.

- `scheme`: whether the endpoint is reachable via http or https protocol.
- `hostname`: the address where the SPARQL endpoint is deployed. Example: `mydomain.com`
- `port`: the port number on which the SPARQL endpoint runs. 
- `queryPath`: this is the path used to make the full endpoint URL.
If the endpoint is `http://mydomain.com/data/sparql`, `queryPath` must be `/data/sparql`.
- `queryParameterName`: When passing a custom query to a SPARQL endpoint, you must use a URL parameter (Example: `http://mydomain.com/data/sparql?query=select%20*%20where%20%7B%3Fs%20%3Fp%20%3Fo%7D%20limit%201`). It's usally `query`, but in case your endpoint uses a different parameter name, you can change it here. 
- `headers`: an object in which you can add custom headers that will be sent with all SPARQL queries to the configured endpoint.
- `defaultAccept`: when no `Accept` format is provided by the user request, these content types are requested by default

### Test

I haven't found a proper way to mock a triple store for testing purposes. I consequently use a remote triple store. That means the tests only work if the machine has Internet access.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```
Tests rely on [mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and 
[supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).

## Start it

```
node bin/www
```

## Use it

See this wiki page for detailed instructions: [Using SPARQL router](https://github.com/ColinMaudry/sparql-router/wiki/Using-SPARQL-router)

The API documentation can be found [here](http://sparql-router.herokuapp.com/) (development version). If you're running the app, at the root (/).
