## Description

[SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) is the query language to retrieve data from RDF triple stores. I often had the issue that fellow developers or data fanatics asked for data that was in a triple store, but they don't know SPARQL.

This module solves the issue:

1. You write the query and gives it a name (e.g. `biggest-asian-cities`)
2. You save it under /tables, /graphs or /update, depending on the query type (SELECT, CONSTRUCT, DESCRIBE, SPARQL Update)
3. You give the URL to your fellow developer, picking the right format for their usage:
	- `http:/yourhost/tables/biggest-asian-cities.csv` for manipulations as a spreadsheet
	- `http:/yourhost/tables/biggest-asian-cities.json` as input for a Web app
	- `http:/yourhost/tables/biggest-asian-cities.xml` if they are into XML
4. They get fresh updated results from the store every time they hit the URL!

## Features

- Exposes SPARQL queries as simple URLs, with choice of result format
- A canned query is a simple file located in `/public/tables`, `/public/graphs` or `/public/update` depending on the query type (SELECT, CONSTRUCT, DESCRIBE, SPARQL Update)
- Beside using FTP and SSH, you can POST a new canned query to `/tables/{query-name}`, `/graphs/{query-name}` or `/update/{query-name}`
- For more query reuse, possibility to populate variable values in the query by passing parameters
- Supports content negotiation (via the `Accept` HTTP header)
- Possibility to GET or POST a SPARQL query on `/sparql` and get the results, without saving it

**[Upcoming features](https://github.com/ColinMaudry/sparql-router/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3Abug)**

**[Known issues](https://github.com/ColinMaudry/sparql-router/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)**

Now it's still jut a useful middleman between your RDF data and your data consumers, but the objective is to develop an open platform to share SPARQL queries on any endpoint. With [a nice UI](https://github.com/ColinMaudry/sparql-router-ui).

## Demo

An instance, with [the develop branch](https://github.com/ColinMaudry/sparql-router/tree/develop), is deployed on Heroku, with API documentation:

https://sparql-router.herokuapp.com

You can create new queries through this form and have fun. Authentication is disabled in the demo:

## Requirements

[NodeJS (4.x or 5.x) and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/stable/) must be installed.

They are also available in most Linux package managers as `nodejs` and `npm`.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ColinMaudry/sparql-router.git
cd sparql-router
npm install
```

SPARQL router is also available as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sparql-router).

## Configuration

[On the wiki](https://github.com/ColinMaudry/sparql-router/wiki/Configuring-SPARQL-router).

### Test

I haven't found a proper way to mock a triple store for testing purposes. I consequently use a remote triple store. That means the tests only work if the machine has Internet access.

The configuration used for the tests is stored in `[app folder]/config/test.json`.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

[Overview of the tests](test/tests.png).

Tests rely on [mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and 
[supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).

## Start it

```
node bin/www
```

## Use it

See this wiki page for detailed instructions: [Using SPARQL router](https://github.com/ColinMaudry/sparql-router/wiki/Using-SPARQL-router)

The API documentation can be found [here](http://sparql-router.herokuapp.com/) (development version). If you're running the app, at the root URL (/).

### Actions that require authentication

The actions that are not read-only on the canned queries or the data require [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

- HTTP POST to create or update a query
- HTTP DELETE to delete a query
- HTTP GET  on the `/update` endpoint (because it affects the data)

## Change log

#### 0.2.0

- Support for SPARQL Update queries (requires authentication)
- Possibility to populate query variable values via URL parameters! ([#10](https://github.com/ColinMaudry/sparql-router/issues/10))
- Queries created and updated via HTTP POST are tested before creation/update
- Possibility to setup user:password for the configured endpoint (Basic authentication)
- The URL of the query is returned when creating or updating a query
- Tested on Fuseki 2.x, [Dydra](http://dydra.com), [Stardog 4.0.5](http://stardog.com/), [OpenLink Virtuoso (LOD cache)](http://lod.openlinksw.com/sparql)
- More useful error messages
- Applied NodeJS security best practices (with [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet))

#### 0.1.0

- Enabled canned queries
- Extension (.csv, .xml, etc.) defines the format returned by the endpoint
- Passthrough queries via `/sparql`
- Create new canned queries by HTTP POST, SSH or FTP
- Basic auth for POST and DELETE
- API doc written in Swagger
- Support for HTTPS endpoints
- CORS support
